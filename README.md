## Procedural Generation Examples

You can at the different projects under the [examples](/examples/) folder for different examples on how to procedurally generate meshes.

### Evergreen Trees

This was my [submission for ProcJam 2022](https://elicdavis.itch.io/evergreen-tree-generation).

## Processing Example

Reads in a obj and applies the cube marching algorithm over the meshes 3D SDF.

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/EliCDavis/polyform/formats/obj"
  "github.com/EliCDavis/polyform/modeling"
  "github.com/EliCDavis/polyform/modeling/marching"
  "github.com/EliCDavis/polyform/modeling/meshops"
  "github.com/EliCDavis/vector"
)

func main() {
  objScene := obj.Load("test-models/stanford-bunny.obj")

  resolution := 10.
  scale := 12.

  transformedMesh := objScene.ToMesh().Transform(
    meshops.CenterAttribute3DTransformer{},
    meshops.ScaleAttribute3DTransformer{Amount: vector3.Fill(scale)},
  )

  canvas := marching.NewMarchingCanvas(resolution)
  meshSDF := marching.Mesh(transformedMesh, .1, 10)
  canvas.AddFieldParallel(meshSDF)

  obj.SaveMesh("chunky-bunny.obj", canvas.MarchParallel(.3))
}
```

Results in:

## Local Development

You can use [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to live reload.

```toml
# .air.toml
[build]
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main.exe ./cmd/polyform"
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html", "js"]
```

The run:

```bash
air edit
```

If you want to mess with modern web browser features and need https, I recommend taking a look at https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert


```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem localhost
air edit --port 8080 --ssl

# If you want to connect to a vr headset
air edit --port 8080 --ssl --host 0.0.0.0
```

### WASM Deployment

Compile the `polywasm` app

```bash
go install ./cmd/polywasm
```

Build your app

```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o main.wasm ./cmd/polyform
polywasm build --wasm main.wasm
```

Then serve

```bash
polywasm edit
```
