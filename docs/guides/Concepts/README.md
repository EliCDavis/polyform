# Concepts

## Variables

Variables are high-level values that a graph exposes for external control. They act as inputs to the procedural generation process. Changing them alters the graph’s behavior without modifying the graph’s structure.

Variables can represent anything from a single number or color to more complex data like positions, textures, or mesh data.

## Profiles

Profiles are saved sets of variable values. They make it easy to store and reuse specific configurations for a graph.

## Manifest

A manifest is the structured output of running a graph with a given set of variables.

It describes what the graph produced, generally including references to generated geometry, textures, or metadata.
