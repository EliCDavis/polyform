# Examples

Each folder is an isolated project that uses different features of polyform.

The rule I set for myself in these examples is that I can never use the command `modeling.NewMesh`. Nothing should be complicated enough that I can't use any of the existing meshing utilities to generate what I want. If that's not the case, then that is inspiration to extend the modeling functionality to solve the problem at hand.
